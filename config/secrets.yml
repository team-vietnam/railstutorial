# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can use `rails secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
# if you're sharing your code publicly.

# I'd like to keep this file in VCS as config/secrets.sample.yml and use it
# as a template to create config/secrets.yml, which is not commited.
# Unfortunately, currently I don't see a way to deploy build artifacts to Heroku
# from GitLab CI, using Dpl.
# See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33115 for details.
